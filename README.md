This is a music mind and technology course assignment where using MIRtoolbox and MATLAB we are analyzing FMRI images of participants (musicians and non-musicians) after listening to music of different genres and mapping the multivoxel pattern. 
Problem are state in the `assignment4_neuroscience.pdf` file. And the final report is in the `report.pdf`
